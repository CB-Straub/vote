This is the start of a blog page using the MERN stack, with login and signup authorization. Users can register and login and make a basic blog post currently. Local storage will save/persist the user and their posts, which are stored in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. Full CRUD operations are in the making where users can add images and edit their own posts in addition to the create and delete functionality that is already in place.  Eventually users will be able to like and comment on another users posts within the blog community. 

Frontend Dependencies: React, Redux-Toolkit, React-Icons, React-Toastify(for notifications), React-Router-Dom, Axios

Backend Dependencies: mongoose, jsonwebtoken, express, dotenv, bcrypt.js
